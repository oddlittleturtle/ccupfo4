# Creation Club Tesla Cannon Unofficial Patch [CCUPFO4]
by oddlittleturtle

## OVERVIEW
An unofficial patch for the Creation Club Tesla Cannon.

### NPC fix -
- Fixes rare issue with Virgil turning hostile by radiation cloak spell if the player has made it to stage 6 of "Best of Three" and inspected the Gunner's Pipboy but has not completed "Virgil's Lab Act III" (DN053).

### Perks fix -
- Perk that applies radiation cloak to the player is removed from the player upon "Best of Three" quest completion to avoid possible complications with friendly fire while completing base game quests.

## FAQ
**What is the difference between this mod and other fixes, patches?**

It only affects the Tesla Cannon creation and is designed to fix exploits or bugs. It is not designed to add random tweaks, "optimizations", or exploits. It is scripted with no base forms touched. As long as no forms are deleted or scripts changed, this patch will be compatible with pretty much anything. Any deletions or script changes could lead to runtime errors or crashes. Double-check descriptions.


**Is the Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch required?**

No. There are no forms touched from the base game to have to include it. It is recommended for use though. (I am not affiliated with the Unofficial Patch Team.)


**Why did you make this?**

I did not realize there was an issue with Virgil until someone on our load order channel pointed out two fix mods when they were having issues on their vanilla game. The fixes that I saw did not actually do anything to fix the underlying issue, which is Virgil is set up to suicide as part of his lab quest if any hostile action by the player is taken against him. (It looks like the Creation's developer forgot about Virgil's behavior and did not take it into consideration, and under normal gameplay conditions should be quite rare.) This causes a similar behavior to the brawl bug. You can simply leave the area for a day and he will reset but returning with the magic effect still active will cause the issue again.

If Bethesda updates the Tesla Cannon, this patch may become obsolete and will be removed or updated as necessary.


**Does this stop the start-up spam?**

No. While the spam at the start can cause an imbalance and exploit by allowing the player to access a high-level area at a low level, it is an open game world, and there are other mods available for delaying the start. (I do wish they had set the CharGen script to check for the player level like the other DLC's check though.)


## LOAD ORDER
Install above UFO4P. It should run and be done before all other mods' scripting starts.

## COMPATIBILITY
Should be compatible with everything. No one really mods this one.


## TECHNICAL SUPPORT
Report issues on GitHub. https://GitHub.com/oddlittleturtle/ccupfo4

If there are other CC that the devs forgot to take into consideration and cause weirdness like Virgil, I'll look into them. If you see something with the scripts you want to change or find a bug with the patch, make a pull request rather than copying source scripts to a new mod or simply report the problem on the issue tracker for me to look into.
