# Contributing
I do not support the removal of mods in the middle of a game, regardless of what type, and the engine is not set up for it. Scripts are external. Start a new game or return to the point of installing it and remove any saves associated with the patch.

### How to report issues
If there are other CC that the devs forgot to take into consideration and cause weirdness like Virgil, I'll look into them. If you find a bug with the patch, report the problem on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/oddlittleturtle/ccupfo4/issues) for me to look into.

### How to Contribute
If you see something with the scripts you want to change or find a bug with the patch, make a pull request rather than copying source scripts to a new mod or simply report the problem on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/oddlittleturtle/ccupfo4/issues) for me to look into.
